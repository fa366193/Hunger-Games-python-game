# Hunger-Games-python-game

 Anyone a fan of Hunger Games and Python? I created a game theory scenario game based on the first Hunger Games book in jupyter notebook.

In this game Katniss decides what strategy to use in the arena, and the careers prepare to stop it. 

In this scenario, Katniss and the careers choose their strategies simultaneously. Both the Katniss and the careers have the option of running or fighting, respectively. The average yards gained or lost in each circumstance can be used as payoffs based on historical data.

If Katniss runs and the careers make the right call, Katniss loses five yards on average. While if Katniss runs and the careers make the wrong call, the average gain is 5 yards; while in hiding, the right career call typically results in no gain of yards. The wrong career call results in a 10 yard gain.
